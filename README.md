## SD201 Final Project

# Data-driven analysis of the history of contemporary mathematics

Explanation of the python files (in ./scripts/):
 - draw_math_graph.py: draws the graph of mathematics as a 20k x 20k png image (see [this image](https://www.easyzoom.com/imageaccess/4042cfe20d1a4e188ca34729b1168888) or the image below).
 - draw_math_and_mathematicians_graph.py: draws a similar graph, but which contains the mathematicians too
 - history of mathematics.py: prints a table (either a readable format, or in latex) of the ranks of the top mathematical concepts since the 19th century (see section 2.4 of the [report](https://github.com/ErwanFagnou/history_of_maths/blob/master/final_report.pdf)).
